# Environment Requirements

* Xcode 12.x
* Swift 5.x


# Dependencies
* iOS communications library is dependant on [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)

## Update dependency
1. install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
2. update the `Cartfile` to version of your choice
3. Run Carthage
> **Note**: As Carthage doesn't work out of the box with Xcode 12. The recommended [workaround](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Xcode12Workaround.md) is used and Carthage is wrapped into script `carthage.sh`

    3.1. Make the script executable
    ```bash
    chmod +x carthage.sh
    ```
    3.2. Run the script
    ```bash
    $ ./carthage.sh update --platform iOS,watchOS
    ```
